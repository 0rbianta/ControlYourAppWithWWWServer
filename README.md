# Control your app with WWW(World Wide Web) server
You can check your Android software with a WWW server. For this, some people use Firebase, DNS, etc. it uses methods and this software uses the WWW server quite simply.

Attention! This method can be hacked by proxying the HTTP Server to localhost. This is a vulnerability in practice. In fact, this method is currently used in PS3. If you are going to do version control or something with this, you risk getting hacked. I will not bother to close this gap, because I use Firebase when necessary. If you are not satisfied with the problem, develop this open source code yourself. If you do, of course, your name will be included in the project.
